{% comment %}
  This template loads the corresponding metadata for a member no matter if it
  is a mapping {img => name} (anonymous members) or just an email string
  (members with an opentechschool.org account.)
  Caveat:  It currently does not allow for usernames which contain only 1
  character.  That's the tradeoff for mixing anonymous and regular members in a
  single collection.
