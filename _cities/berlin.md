## About

We are the group of people who created the first chapter of OpenTechSchool and
want you to start one in your own city! The venue that supported us from the
very beginning and where we host our events is the fantastic coworking space,
[co.up]. This is also where we hold our bi-weekly breakfast meeting â€“
the best way to meet us and talk about new ideas and projects!
